# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).


## For adding new Python packages to SageMaker Distribution
SageMaker Distribution will add new Python packages only during a minor/major version release. 
New packages will not be added during a patch version release.

Follow these steps for sending out a pull request for adding new packages:
1. Identify the latest version of SageMaker Distribution.
2. Create the next minor/major version's build artifacts folder here: https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-distribution/tree/main/build_artifacts
3. Currently, SageMaker Distribution is using Conda forge channel as our source (for Python 
   packages). 
   Ensure that the new package which you are trying to add is present in Conda forge channel. https://conda-forge.org/feedstock-outputs/
4. Create {cpu/gpu}.additional_packages_env.in file in that folder containing the new packages. 
   Specify the new package based on the following examples:

   i. conda-forge::new-package
   
   ii. conda-forge::new-package[version='>=some-version-number,<some-version-number']
5. Run the following commands to verify whether the new package which you are trying to add is 
   compatible with the existing packages in SageMaker Distribution
   ```
   This project uses Conda to manage its dependencies. Run the following to setup your local environment:

   conda env update --file environment.yml -n sagemaker-distribution
   
   conda activate sagemaker-distribution
   
   export BASE_PATCH_VERSION='current.latest.version'
   
   # NEXT_VERSION refers to the version number corresponding to the folder you created as part 
   of Step 2.
   
   export NEXT_VERSION='specify.next.version'
   
   # If NEXT_VERSION is a new minor version:
   
   python src/main.py create-minor-version-artifacts --base-patch-version=$BASE_PATCH_VERSION --force
   
   # Or for a new major version:
   
   python src/main.py create-major-version-artifacts --base-patch-version=$BASE_PATCH_VERSION --force
   
   # Build the image:
   python src/main.py build \
     --target-patch-version=$NEXT_VERSION --skip-tests

   ```
6. Ensure that the build command succeeds. If it fails, then it means that the package isn't 
   compatible with the existing packages in SageMaker Distribution. Create a Github Issue, so 
   that we can look more into it.
7. Add the relevant tests in https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-distribution/blob/main/test/test_dockerfile_based_harness.py 
    and run the build command once again without `--skip-tests` flag.
8. Submit the PR containing the following files.
   * {cpu/gpu}.additional_packages_env.in files
   * All the test files and test_dockerfile_based_harness.py changes
   
   Note: you don't have to include other files such as env.in/ env.out/ Dockerfile etc in your PR
   
   Also Note: We might ask you to include the test results as part of the PR.

## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
