# pandas.test() by default runs with `-m "not slow and not network and not db"`. However, we found a few tests in the
# test_network.py file that should have been marked as "network" but weren't, so we skip those here. We skip S3 specific
# tests for the same reason.
# We skip `test_plain_axes` too: the Pandas dev environment expects matplotlib to be ">=3.6.1, <3.7.0" but the runtime
# expectation is just ">=3.6.1". Our image contains v3.7.1, so it meets the latter requirement but not the former. This
# particular test, however, only works with the former requirement. (We verified that the test succeeds if we manually
# drop the version to v3.6.x) So, we skip it.
# Also skipping specific TestFrameFlexArithmetic test; failing due to known issue https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54546
