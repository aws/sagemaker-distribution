### Shared folder
The shared folder:
- Contains files visible to all project members
- Is accessible across all your tools
- Updates immediately when any member adds or modifies files

### Personal local folder
Your personal local folder:
- Includes this root folder and any subfolders (except shared)
- Allows you to work on files privately

To share your files with other project members, copy or move them to the shared folder when ready.
